In the code of LSTM_FROM_SCRACH, we have designed an LSTM network from scratch without using predefined libraries on a sequence of random numbers, and this network has reached Las 6.8 in 50 training epochs.

## In the code... we have created a sequence of the movement of a geometric shape as frames and we have tried this sequence on three simple RNN networks, LSTM and GRU, and compared their accuracy. As a result, the accuracy of GRU is higher than all other recurrent networks. This will be a geometric doubt to estimate the next move.
