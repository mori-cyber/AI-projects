## Analysis of stock market data

## IranKhodro

#### In this project, I used Iran Khodro's stock market data on the Kodal website.
- [X] First, I calculated and obtained the features with more positive and negative correlations than the closing price of transactions per day using Pearson correlation.
- [X] Second, I calculated the logarithmic normalization on columns with higher correlations. 
- [X] Thirdly, a time series for 60 days. I created it from the data.
- [X] Fourth, I allocated 80% of the data to Terin and the rest to the test data and trained the model on Terin's data.
- [X] finally evaluated the model with mean squared error and RMSE.
