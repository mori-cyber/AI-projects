# voice-classification
In this task, we have created a dataset of about 10 people's voices. The goal is to create a model using recurrent networks such as RNN, LSM, or GRU to train these voice sequences on these networks and then recognize each voice. of the participants. In this way, each of the participants sends their voice through a Telegram bot and their voice is recognized.
you  can create your dataset and use a telegram bot to recognize Any sound in your dataset
# First create your voice dataset
# Second split dataset into train and test 
# Third create your model
# Fourth use a bot to recognize any voice in your dataset
# In this repo, PyTorch is used in the Colab environment
If you use Google Collab, you need to install this package:
!pip install pydub
